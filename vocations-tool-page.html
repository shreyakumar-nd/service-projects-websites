         <h1>Vocations Data Tool</h1>

         <h2>Project Background</h2>
         <p>This project involves creating a web application that allows the priests of the Holy Cross to easily manage their applicants. It will keep track of the applicantâ€™s basic information like name, birthday, address, and other information like times they visit the university, medical records, and transcripts. The web application production currently exists on Azure, and the development stage is also on Azure. Our aim is to update the website with new features, fix a few bugs addressed by the stakeholders, and create documentation on how the different processes work, such as GitHub, Jira, AWS, and Azure.</p>

         <h2>Website Demo</h2>

         <h2>Our Work</h2>
         <p>We began the semester planning to transition the website to be hosted on Azure. However, that expectation changed when we learned that our project lead, Seth, completed that over the summer. With that being accomplished, our task became twofold: to improve the website and to create comprehensive documentation for others to take over in the future. We developed new features for the website and fixed existing bugs as well as developed guides on how to run the website locally, how to develop using proper Git hygene, how to connect to the Azure database via MySQL Workbench, and how to use the Jira board. The tasks we worked on are detailed below.</p>
         <h3>1. Environment UI Banner</h3>
         <div class='row'>
            <div class='col-sm-6'><img class='img img-responsive' src='vocations_images/ui-banner.png' alt='UI Banner'></div>
            <div class='col-sm-6'>
               <p>When interacting with the vocations website, users can navigate through several environments: Testing, Testing2, Staging, Dev, and Production. Currently, the website does not display any indicators to inform users of the environment they are accessing. Our stakeholders, the priests, have requested the implementation of a UI banner that clearly denotes the current environment to the user.</p>
            </div>
         </div>

         <h3>2. Add/Remove Sources</h3>
         <p>The client requested the ability to add and remove entries from the "source" database with the click of a button. We implemented buttons that trigger a popup window and corresponding database queries for the user to be able to add or remove a source from the database with ease.</p>
         <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4 text-center">
               <img src='vocations_images/add-remove-sources.png' alt='Add/Remove Sources Buttons' class="img-responsive">
               <p>This image displays the buttons to add or remove a source next to the "source" dropdown</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 text-center">
               <img src='vocations_images/add-source-popup.png' alt='Add Sources Popup' class="img-responsive">
               <p>This image displays the popup that appears to add a source</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 text-center">
               <img src='vocations_images/remove-source-popup.png' alt='Remove Sources Popup' class="img-responsive">
               <p>This image displays the popup that appears to remove a source</p>
            </div>
         </div>

         <h3>3. Source Search Filter</h3>
         <p>The site had various source drop-downs that could be used on the site. The client wanted it to be possible to select more than one of these options at a time including the ones that could be added/removed from the ticket above.</p>
         <img src="vocations_images/sourcetab.png" alt="shows the source tab" class="img-responsive">

         <h3>4. Null DOB Field</h3>
         <p>The client wanted us to fix a bug that would occur when presenting the date of birth of a user if they had yet to input a value. Before we made changes if a user did not input their date of birth, it would show up as 00-00-0000, we changed this so that it would either appear as the word Null or in other cases it appears as mm/dd/yyyy. Below are images of an empty date of birth field no longer appearing as 00-00-0000.</p>
         <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4">
               <img src="vocations_images/Null.png" alt="Shows the date of birth field as null" class="img-responsive">
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
               <img src="vocations_images/mmddyyyy.png" alt="Shows the date of birth field as mm/dd/yyyy" class="img-responsive">
            </div>
         </div>

         <h3>5. Required College Field</h3>
         <div class='row'>
            <div class='col-sm-6'>
               <p>The website displayed a minor issue on the 'Add Prospect' page. Initially, the page erroneously labeled what should have been the 'College' field as 'School.' Moreover, this field was set as mandatory, despite not always being necessary for user objectives.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='col-sm-6'><img class='img img-responsive' src='vocations_images/college-field-requirement.png' alt='College Field Requirement'></div>
         </div>

         <h2>Teamwork</h2>
         <p>Teamwork has been an essential element in the progress of our project. A prime instance of our collaborative efforts was during the initial phase where we set up our development servers and established a connection to the website. This task was arguably the most intricate, yet our collective approach proved effective. Marc took the initiative by experimenting with AWS and Ubuntu, which ultimately became our chosen solution. Following this, Max adeptly continued the process, focusing on the website integration. Concurrently, Marc anticipated potential challenges and began updating the UI through Azure development slots as a contingency measure in case of connectivity issues.</p>
         <p>Our teamwork extends beyond task completion; it encompasses mutual support. Max has been instrumental in assisting Patrick with troubleshooting several ticket-related problems, while Marc has adeptly resolved a connection issue with the GitHub repository using AWS. Furthermore, Max ensures a culture of meticulousness by seeking peer reviews for all documentation and materials before their dissemination. Additionally, the dynamic nature of our team was tested when two members joined us for a three-week stint; we not only managed their onboarding seamlessly but also promptly adapted to cover their responsibilities upon their departure.</p>

         <h2>Getting Started</h2>
         <p>First, you're going to need to get access to the GitHub repository, Confluence, and the Jira board. As of now, Seth Cattanach (scattanach1@gmail.com) controls access to those, so send him an email to get access as soon as possible. If Seth is no longer running the Vocations website, contact the other stakeholders listed above for guidance or ask the professor for additional contacts.</p>
         <p>Once you have access, set up your development environment by going through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AxBHGZmDXDYrHpO1SjjiHg6vdWF8J63z9D2FFzjsRU4/edit?usp=sharing">Environment Setup Guide</a> and corresponding <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cwy1NGdz-frDSuvqj2HUylBr8yJZ5kuE/view?usp=sharing">Walkthrough Video</a>.</p>
