         <h2>Reflection</h2>
         <p>Reflecting on our teamwork, several key practices stood out and contributed to our success:<br />
<u></u>Consistent Weekly Meetings</u> were a significant factor. Every team member consistently showed up, which was crucial for our cohesion and progress on the project. We used these sessions not just for catching up but also for strategically planning our week. By setting clear goals, assigning tasks, and planning our sprints, we managed to stay focused and efficient.
<br /><u>Effective Communication Through Group Text</u> was another vital aspect. In between our weekly meetings, we maintained our momentum through our group text. This tool served as more than just a platform for updates; it was where we could flag issues, ask questions, and ensure everyone was on track with their tasks. It was instrumental in keeping us connected and ensuring that we did not overlook any critical details.
<br /><u>Active Engagement with Our Project User</u>, Alec, played a significant role in our project's direction and success. Regular check-ins with Alec were invaluable; he provided not only his perspective but also feedback from actual users of our dashboard. This direct connection to the end-users was crucial in helping us prioritize our tasks and focus our efforts effectively.
<br /><u>Collaboration and Flexibility</u> within the team were vital. Everyone was willing to chip in where needed, which enhanced our team dynamics. We were flexible, adapting to new information or changes in our project scope, and this adaptability proved to be a key element in our success. Our team suggests these key practices for the future.</p>
