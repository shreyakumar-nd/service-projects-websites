         <h1>Project Story</h1>
         <p>This semester, our group was tasked with developing a data visualization tool for the ACE Path program. This tool takes responses from a survey created in Qualtrics that is used to track students’ progression throughout school and create a platform that would allow counselors to view and analyze these results. We were passed down a Tableau workbook that was created from the previous semester’s group and made edits to this workbook to fit the needs of our clients. These needs varied over the course of the semester and included tasks such as color coding, creating a notification system, developing a “scholar profile,” and removing duplicate data. At various points throughout the semester, we would hold meetings with the client to gather feedback on our progress. This communication throughout the semester was incredibly helpful, as it helped to get feedback and ideas from the client directly so that we could understand ways to improve our project. With each meeting, we received new tasks. By the end of the semester, we were able to transform a very basic Tableau workbook into a user-friendly visualization tool that included everything the student’s counselor would need to know in an easy-to-read format. Some of the features that we added were color coding, profile alerts, a post-secondary education dashboard, a scholar profile, a system that allows counselors to leave notes on student profiles, linking all pages to each dashboard, cleaning the data, and making our project mobile-friendly. This has resulted in a very successful, functional system that allows each student to be more seen and easier to help. It can display a very extensive survey that each student takes in easy-to-understand visualizations and will overall improve the counselor's ability to help each student.</p>

         <h2>Reflection</h2>
         <p><b>Reflecting on our teamwork, several key practices stood out and contributed to our success:</b><br />
<u>Consistent Weekly Meetings</u> were a significant factor. Every team member consistently showed up, which was crucial for our cohesion and progress on the project. We used these sessions not just for catching up but also for strategically planning our week. By setting clear goals, assigning tasks, and planning our sprints, we managed to stay focused and efficient.
<br /><u>Effective Communication Through Group Text</u> was another vital aspect. In between our weekly meetings, we maintained our momentum through our group text. This tool served as more than just a platform for updates; it was where we could flag issues, ask questions, and ensure everyone was on track with their tasks. It was instrumental in keeping us connected and ensuring that we did not overlook any critical details.
<br /><u>Active Engagement with Our Project User</u>, Alec, played a significant role in our project's direction and success. Regular check-ins with Alec were invaluable; he provided not only his perspective but also feedback from actual users of our dashboard. This direct connection to the end-users was crucial in helping us prioritize our tasks and focus our efforts effectively.
<br /><u>Collaboration and Flexibility</u> within the team were vital. Everyone was willing to chip in where needed, which enhanced our team dynamics. We were flexible, adapting to new information or changes in our project scope, and this adaptability proved to be a key element in our success. Our team suggests these key practices for the future.</p>
